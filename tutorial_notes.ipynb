    "The general instructions on set up are in the README, but a more detailed explanation is given in this section. \n",

    "I would personally recommend using PyCharm as an IDE for personal development. The professional version is free for students as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Anaconda is also necessary for this project. [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) is the lightest version you can install. It is a purely terminal based version of Anaconda. You may also download the [full featured version](https://www.anaconda.com/download) which comes with a graphical user interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conda in summary is a Python virtual environment tool which I highly recommend for projects that have a lot of library dependencies or when you have multiple projects with different versions of the same library. \n",

    "```shell\n",
    "conda create --name lnc\n",

    "\n",
    "This command is how you create new Conda virtual environments. The name could be anything you want, I simply chose lnc as short for Lyapunov neural control. \n",

    "```shell\n",

    "These scripts are what take your models and trains a neural network controller and neural network Lyapunov function simultaneously. Examples of what a training file looks like can be found in *examples/*. I will now reference the inverted pendulum case to help explain the process.
