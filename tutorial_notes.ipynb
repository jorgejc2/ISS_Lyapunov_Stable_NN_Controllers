    "# Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "## General Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The general instructions on set up are in the README, but a more detailed explanation is given in this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would personally recommend using PyCharm as an IDE for Python development. The professional version is free for students as well. I will also add references on how to configure the IDE as this project uses a lot of long parameters and environment variables that would be very repetitive to set every time upon opening the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Anaconda is also necessary for this project. [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) is the lightest version you can install. It is a purely terminal based version of Anaconda. You may also download the [full featured version](https://www.anaconda.com/download) which comes with a graphical user interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conda in summary is a Python virtual environment tool which I highly recommend for projects that have a lot of library dependencies or when you have multiple projects with different versions of the same libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "After installing, move to the root directory of this project and run\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda create --name iss_lnc python=3.11 jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command is how you create new Conda virtual environments. The name could be anything you want. Jupyter is at the end so that it can be installed in the conda environment and be used in PyCharm (unfortunately Jupyter notebooks can only be used in Pycharm Professional but it is free for students). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see a list of all of your Conda environments, you can run\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda env list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The activate command is how you choose an environment to use for your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda activate iss_lnc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done using an environment, you can run\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this pip install command downloads all the library packages needed into your conda environment. From this point forward, make sure that you are inside the iss_lnc environment as this is the environment we are configuring/using.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verifier Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Disregard cloning the verifier, I have added the Github repository for the verifier in this project as a module. After cloning this repository for the first time, you will need to also run this once:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "git submodule init\n",
    "git submodule update\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two commands installs additional dependencies into your environment for running the verifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "(cd alpha-beta-CROWN/auto_LiRPA && pip install -e .)\n",
    "(cd alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier && pip install -r requirements.txt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## PyCharm Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have opened the project in PyCharm, navigate to the bottom left to configure an interpreter for the project. We want to make sure you are using the Conda environment that you have created. If you have used an interpret in a previous PyCharm project, it will automatically appear. If not, then you have to navigate towards *Add New Interpreter* and *Add Local Interpeter*\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/opening_interpreter.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this menu, navigate to *Conda Environment* and find the *iss_lnc* conda environment. Select it and hit 'ok'. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/add_interpreter.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start with PyCharm configurations, I have added a quick Python script called *set_env_vars.py*. Run this Python script like any other (it's a very simple script so you don't even need to be in the *iss_lnc* env to run it). It will then create a *set_env_vars.env* file that will make it very easy to use in your configuration files. I left my own environment file as an example of what the output will look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "After running the script, you will get a file that pertains to your directories. These should be familiar from the original README. These environment variables are needed so that the path to this project and the verifier are known when running the different Python scripts/modules. Unfortunately these must be set everytime you run a new terminal instance, but this configuration set up will eliminate the need to remember or do such a task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are going to create a new configuration. There are two main configurations for this project, configurations to train a controller and Lyapunov function, and configurations to verify a Lyapunov function. You may find it helpful to create more configurations for other repetitive tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the top right and hit *edit configurations* to create your first configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/Open_Configurations.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I will show my current configuration and describe what each component is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/Inverted_Pendulum_Configuration.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By default, this should select your *iss_lnc* Conda environment. If it doesn't make sure to select it. This also allows you to run different scripts with different environments, but we only need one for this project. \n",
    "2. This is the path to the script to run. For this configuration, we will be running the *abcrown.py* script which can be found in the *alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier/* directory. \n",
    "3. These are where you can pass in parameters. For verification, you need to use the .yaml file for the system you are trying to verify. The full parameters I have set here is \"--config /home/jorgejc2/Documents/ClassRepos/ISS_Lyapunov_Stable_NN_Controllers/verification/pendulum_state_feedback_lyapunov_in_levelset.yaml\". Make sure to use the correct path here. \n",
    "4. This is the working directory to run the script from. PyCharm should automatically infer where to run the script from, but I like to specify this to have more control. The directory here is simply *alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier/* which is the directory that holds the script we are running.  \n",
    "5. Here you can manually add the environment variables needed for the run, but in our case, we saved them to a file that we can simply import. \n",
    "6. This should point to the location of your *set_env_vars.env* file. This sets the environment variables for the run. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you can simply run or debug the script. You can also change the parameters to try and verify a different system, or add a new configuration with different parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how you no longer have to export these environment variables every time or specify the parameters. When you make new configurations as well, you can simply reference this configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Training\n",
    "\n",
    "These scripts are what take your models and trains a neural network controller and neural network Lyapunov function simultaneously. Examples of what a training file looks like can be found in *examples/*. I will now reference the inverted pendulum case to help explain the process. The inverted pendulum is defined as the following dynamics:\n",
